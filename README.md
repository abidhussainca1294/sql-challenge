In this project, the tables are designed to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a PostgreSQL database, and then SQL queries are  written  to answer questions about the data. 
Following operations are performed data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.
Free tool QuickDBD is used for data modelling by sketching an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables.
pgAdmin4 is used for creating and querying SQL database.
